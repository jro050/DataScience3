Data analysis with the goal of creating a machine learning classifier of voice patterns to identify Parksinsons Disease.
The dataset was downloaded from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinsons

The data is from the following paper: 'Exploiting Nonlinear Recurrence and Fractal Scaling Properties for Voice Disorder Detection', Little MA, McSharry PE, Roberts SJ, Costello DAE, Moroz IM. BioMedical Engineering OnLine 2007, 6:23 (26 June 2007) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5434464/
